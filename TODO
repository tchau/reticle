TODO
============================================================

modifying ANY attribute ... shows change immediately... 
or... how bout.. even HOVERING over any value...? ?? 


PRIMARY EDITING
- EDIT ATTRS
    - need to implement VALUE ASSIST
		- value helpers (url, img, number, on/off, form_id) showing the valid values
        what are the value "types"? 
            - text
            - pixels
            - URL
            - number
            - MIME_type
            - specific enum set [left / right/ top /middle /bottom]
                                [on / off]
            - specific [e.g. "checked", "required", "readonly"]
      - always an open field -- with a contextual helper. being an open field means it can be templatable
		- data helpers: if you want to insert substitutions like {{item.id}} ---- perhaps this should be done almost anywhere...?


APPEND MENU
  - Info Panel explaining all the ELs (attrs and tags and such)
  - create objects with interesting defaults
  - refresh the preview even AS you are cycling through POSSIBILITIES

META;
  try fixing the busted appearanceof the meta
  custom renders for certain tags


NAVIGATION
  - reconsider the current scope in/out scheme... perhaps a pure flat scheme makes sense? 
   - reconsider the modulus navigation (its kinda disorienting)


TEMPLATING (json-t)
  - JSON insert and then, render navigator view
  - create template variable
  - create template block
  - data helper (navigate the JSON structure)

HELP
  - controls help at bottom of sceren
  - live preview on right


MENU MANAGER
  - make the choices clickable/mouse-overable not just typable
  

EFFECTS
  can visuals bemade morre subtle?
    no borders
    show the meta info when needed - some attrs (that matter for navigation) are always present; others show only when you get near them

  - menu positioning is fucked up
  - floaty checkmark when you've committed
  - floaty x when you've cancelled
  - reticle has commands ON it [add insert edit]. the available comands are also context sensitive
  consider whether all the tags and data need to be shown on meta-layer...
  maybe only show one layer deep?
  also reconsider the appearance of the bottom level inline elements (A, SPAN) and whether they nede all that....

EXPORT
- code generate (export)


CSS
- CSS context; given the classes here which rules are applied with the stylesheets we have?
- CSS Search: quickly pull up style editor for this node (shows rules that apply - pick one to edit -- boom, edit right there. no context switch.)

ADVANCED MANIPULATION
- copy / pasta
- undo / redo



============================================================
VISUALS
============================================================

- menu "blips" in on the right, and blips away when you commit or cancel
- help icon in lower right



============================================================
DONE
============================================================

- appending new node after
- deletes
- insert inside
  - append after, inside [ok]
  - context-sensitive (what tags make sense inside this one)


- INLINE EDIT
  A appends a text node after this element
  I inserts a text node inside this element
  ESC exits edit mode for that node, puts you back into NAV
  ENTER commits the node

- EDIT ATTRS
  - saves
  - shows all possible attributes for this elemenet, what they do
  - use defaultValues

LIVE PREVIEW
  - show the preview
