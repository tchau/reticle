PRIMARY EDITING

- INLINE EDIT
  A appends a text node after this element
  I inserts a text node inside this element
  ESC exits edit mode for that node, puts you back into NAV
  ENTER commits the node
  [ reticle appearance is kinda funky when editing text nodes...  ]

- EDIT ATTRS
		- shows all possible attributes for this elemenet, what they do
		- value helpers (url, img, number, on/off, form_id) 
		  that show you the valid values
		- data helpers: if you want to insert substitutions like {{item.id}} ---- perhaps this should be done almost anywhere...?
- APPEND MENU
  info panel explaining all the values (attrs and tags and such)
  always create objects with interesting defaults

NAVIGATION
- reconsider the current scope in/out scheme... perhaps a pure flat scheme makes sense? 
- reconsider the modulus navigation (its kinda disorienting)

HELP
- controls help at bottom of sceren
- live preview on right

MENU MANAGER
- make it absolute positioned like a dialog
- blip it in and out


TEMPLATING
- templating (JSON-T)
- data view (navigate the JSON structure)


EXPORT
- code generate (export)


CSS
- CSS context; given the classes here which rules are applied with the stylesheets we have?
- CSS Search: quickly pull up style editor for this node (shows rules that apply - pick one to edit -- boom, edit right there. no context switch.)

ADVANCED MANIPULATION
- copy / pasta
- undo / redo



============================================================
VISUALS
============================================================

- menu "blips" in on the right, and blips away when you commit or cancel
- help icon in lower right



============================================================
DONE
============================================================

- appending new node after
- deletes
- insert inside
  - append after, inside [ok]
  - context-sensitive (what tags make sense inside this one)
